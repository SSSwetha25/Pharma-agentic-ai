# Agentic AI for Pharmaceutical Innovation

An Agentic AI–based decision support system that accelerates early-stage pharmaceutical research by decomposing complex strategy questions into coordinated, domain-specific analyses.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Pharmaceutical companies aiming to move beyond low-margin generics often explore **value-added and repurposed drug opportunities**. However, identifying such opportunities requires extensive manual research across clinical trials, patents, and market data—often taking months.

This project presents an **Agentic AI–based research assistant** that demonstrates how such analysis can be **modularized, automated, and synthesized** using an agent-oriented architecture.

The system accepts a high-level research query and coordinates multiple specialized agents to generate structured insights and a consolidated research report.
